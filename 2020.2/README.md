# Postfix haskell
This is a low-level functional programming language I started planning and working on in August of 2020. The planning is a bit more sparse, because most of the planning was done in my head before writing some example programs in the ph/examples/ folder.

## What's in here?
Here I plan to put things that aren't fully consistent but still show thought processes. So for example comparing lanugage to haskell or code for syntax options that aren't complete progams. Example programs, (which hopefully will one day work). Will remain in the other repo.
