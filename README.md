# lang-spec
gathering fleeting thoughts for my PLs

## 2020.1
[This language's implementation now lives here](https://github.com/dvtate/scl).

- Stack-based Bytecode
- Separated compiler and vm
- Designed to be somewhat similar to javascript


## 2020.2
[This language's implementation now lives here](https://github.com/dvtate/postfix-haskell).

- Postfix and functional
- Compiles to WASM
- Compiler written in JS so that it can be run in browser
